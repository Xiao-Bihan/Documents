************************************************
some extra tips:

'' (two single quotes) takes you back to where you were so gg=G''

I'll never be able to unlearn my precious 1G =) One of my favorites is =% standing on an opening bracket. It fixes the indents of the whole block.

To indent a block of code, go to one of the braces and use command
=%

To indent the all the lines below the current line
=G

To indent the current line
